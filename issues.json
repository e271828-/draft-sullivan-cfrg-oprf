I plan to have a more detailed run-through soon, particularly with the algorithmic stuff to make sure the inputs/outputs are consistent throughout. Maybe the best thing would be to respond to the comments on here and then I can change/not change accordingly?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure of the process for IETF drafts but I guess there will need to be some justification of the security properties that are proposed. I guess proofs might be a stretch but it might be possible to get some intuition down, what do you think?\r\n\r\nAlso, were there any TODOs that you were considering before you went ahead with submission?\r\n\r\n(I tried make-ing the changes but it was complaining about the {{H2c}} reference?)"
